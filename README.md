# IP-Changer

Currently requires to be ran as administrator to change the IP but will bypass this in the future. 

Previouse test builds were false flagged by windows defender. Virus Total showed 4 AV showing false flags but current version did not get false flagged by windows defender but has not been tested on other systems. If you do get a false flag, please contact me on contact@fustech.com.au with the AV company that has given a false flag so I can get in contact with them to sort it out ASAP.
